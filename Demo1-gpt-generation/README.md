# GPT2-Blackbox
This demo folder showcases the usage of the GPT-2 language model as a black box using the Keras deep learning framework. GPT-2 is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like text. In this demo, we'll provide a simple example of how to use GPT-2 for text generation without diving into the model's internal architecture.
