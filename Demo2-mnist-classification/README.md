# MNIST Classification

This demo folder provides instructions on training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for MNIST digit classification from scratch. We'll walk you through the process of creating and training a CNN model using Python and Multi-backend Keras. In addition, we will also show techniques within Keras that enable fine-tuning and transfer learning.
