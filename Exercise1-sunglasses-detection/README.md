# Sunglasses Detection

In this exercise, you will learn how to train a machine learning classification model from scratch to determine whether a person in an image is wearing sunglasses or not. You will use a dataset containing images of people's faces as the training data and implement a binary classification model using Python and a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

`sunglasses-classification.ipynb`: This notebook contains the solution for the sunglasses detection exercise. It goes through how to set up and train a model, and how to analyze it.
`sunglasses-classification-starter.ipynb`: This notebook contains the starter code for the sunglasses detection exercise. It provides a structured environment for you to work on the exercise step by step.
`sunglasses-dataset`: The dataset that you will working on. We have organised it for you into two folders (`sunglasses` and `no_sunglasses`) for the respective classes.
